    "# Introduction\n",
    "A [Radar Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart) (or Spyder Chart) is a method of plotting multiple variables on two dimensions. When we have several variables about something, we can plot each of them on an axis of a spyder plot. This can be especially useful when we want to compare several variables within a group, or between groups.\\\n",
    "We should, however, be aware of the possible problems that might arise when using these plots. Certain changes that we might need to make on our data in order to plot it effectively on a radar chart might cause confusions, especially when trying to compare variables.\\\n",
    "In this article, I will show you how to draw radar charts using both R and Python. Along the way, I will show you how certain decisions we make in preparing the data we use to draw these charts might have consequences that we might like or dislike. The most important aspect, in my opinion, is to be aware of such matters before we use these plots to convey any message.\\\n",

This different approach leads to a completely different plot. Here, all of our variables are on the same scale.
